vagrant-spark-zepplin
===========================

# 1. Introduction

Vagrant project to spin up a single node Apache Spark 1.6.0 (pre-built for Apache Hadoop 2.6) and Apache Zepplin 0.5.5-incubating.

# 2. Prerequisites

1. At least 1GB memory in addition to the memory for your host machine.
2. Vagrant 1.7 or higher.
3. VirtualBox 4.3.2 or higher.

# 3. Getting Started

1. Download and install VirtualBox.
2. Download and install Vagrant.
3. Git clone this project, and change directory into this project directory.
4. Run `vagrant up` to create the VM.
5. Run `vagrant ssh` to get into your VM.
6. Run `vagrant destroy` when you want to destroy and get rid of the VM.

# 4. Note

- The base box for CentOS 6.4 will be downloaded from http://wdev.qa.admarketplace.net.
- If you run `vagrant up` for the very first time, Oracle JDK 8, Spark 1.6.0, Zepplin 0.5.5 will be automatically downloaded and installed, and copied to the `/resources` directory. Next time, when you run `vagrant up`, the files in the `/resources` directory will be used instead, which will make the boot-up time fast. In the future, these files will be included as part of the base box.
- log4j log level is configured to WARN.
- This uses Oracle JDK 8.
- This comes with Python 2.6.x.
